  <br>
  <p>I am currently the Commericial Field Service Manager for SoCal Supercharger Network. 
    I really enjoy the work but it can be a bit stressful. Right now I am up in San Jose doing an audit of the Training Program!</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>I am married to one of the most thoughtful woman I have ever met. While away she painted my home office and is taking care of our fur babies.
    I miss my family terribly!
